    <p>Often, a user first experience with a computer is through GUIs where visual components 
        represent potential user actions. It is more common and user friendly. Although easier to use,a GUI is considered slower due to more visual output,
         which requires more memory than a text-based CLI.</p>
     <h2>Why we bother to use CLI?</h2>
   
      <p>
        <li>
        CLI allows users to perform tasks quickly and efficiently by executing commands with concise syntax, reducing the need for navigating 
        through GUIs.For example,you have a large no of folders and to search for a specific file you will go within the folders consuming a lot of time, instead 
        you can simply use the command ls to know the directory files.
       </li>
        <li>
        The CLI efficiency is particularly beneficial for experienced
        users, automation scripts, and remote server administration, where speed and precision
        in executing commands can significantly improve productivity.

     <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of how to use important CLI commands:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        $ cd /path/to/directory   -->     Change directory 
        $ ls                      -->     List files and directories
        $ mkdir new_directory     -->     Create a new directory
        $ touch new_file.txt      -->     Create a new empty file
        $ cat text_file.txt       -->     Display the contents of a file
        $ ps                      -->     List running processes
        $ ping example.com        -->     Test network connectivity
        $ useradd new_user        -->     Create a new user
     </code>
